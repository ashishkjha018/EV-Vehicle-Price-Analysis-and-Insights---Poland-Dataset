# EV-Vehicle-Price-Analysis-and-Insights---Poland-Dataset
This repository contains an analysis of EV vehicle specifications and pricing using a dataset from Poland. Includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization with Python to uncover insights into price trends and vehicle features. Perfect for data enthusiasts and EV market analysts.

# Key Features
# Task 1: Budget and Range Analysis
Filtered EVs within a budget of 350,000 PLN and a minimum range of 400 km.
Grouped results by manufacturer and calculated the average battery capacity for each brand.

# Task 2: Identifying Energy Consumption Outliers
Detected anomalies in energy consumption (mean energy consumption [kWh/100 km]) using statistical methods.

# Task 3: Relationship Between Battery Capacity and Range
Visualized and analyzed the correlation between battery capacity and range, providing actionable insights on EV efficiency.

# Task 4: EV Recommendation System
Built a Python class to recommend the top 3 EVs based on user inputs such as budget, desired range, and battery capacity.

# Task 5: Hypothesis Testing
Conducted a two-sample t-test to compare the average engine power of Tesla and Audi EVs.
Derived insights and provided actionable recommendations for manufacturers and consumers.

# Technologies and Tools Used
